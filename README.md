### JavaScript-calculator

### Description
This is a calculator project to help me better understand JavaScript, the goal of this project is to make a calculator which does basic and advanced calculations and add on different features depending on the time left over.

### Installation
just download files as zip and run the index.html file located in sparta-js-calculator, follow on screen instructions.

### Code Snippets
//power
case "5":
answ = Math.pow(+number_1, +number_2)
alert(number_1+" ^ "+number_2 +" = "+answ);
break;

from the code above I learnt that you need to append number_1  with a + or - sign to treat the variables as numbers otherwise they will be treated as strings.
